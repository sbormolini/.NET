    // Builder interface (at least in a statically typed programming
    // language).
    //
    // Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder
    // instance is expected to be ready to start producing another product.
    // That's why it's a usual practice to call the reset method at the end
    // of the `GetProduct` method body. However, this behavior is not
    // mandatory, and you can make your builders wait for an explicit reset
    // call from the client code before disposing of the previous result.
