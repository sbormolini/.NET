# C# Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns
- **Abstract Factory** Creates an instance of several families of classes
- **Builder** Separates object construction from its representation
- **Factory Method** Creates an instance of several derived classes
- **Prototype**	A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- **Singleton**	A class of which only a single instance can exist

## Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** Match interfaces of different classes
- **Bridge** Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
- **Composite**	A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- **Decorator**	Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- **Facade** A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- **Flyweight**	A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- **Proxy**	An object representing another object

## Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Resp.** A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- **Command** Encapsulate a command request as an object
- **Interpreter** A way to include language elements in a program
- **Iterator** Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- **Mediator** Defines simplified communication between classes
- **Memento** Capture and restore an object's internal state
- **Observer** A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- **State**	Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- **Strategy** Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- **Template** Method	Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- **Visitor** Defines a new operation to a class without change
